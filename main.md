## Proposal
A two-player TTRPG. </br>
One plays a child, the other plays a person meant to be responsible for them. </br>
</br>

## Players

### The Person

The person's objective is to improve the child's wellbeing.</br>

The person always has an unfair advantage over the child: their testimony will be held in higher regard than the child's; they can physically overpower the child; they can restrain the child. They will take these actions to safeguard the wellbeing of the child. These statements remain true regardless of stats or skill checks.

#### Skills
The person has the following skills:
- Empathy (understanding how the child is feeling)
- Judgement (making decisions in the best interests of the child)
- Patience (tolerating their child when they become difficult to be around)
- Alertness (noticing when things change about the child) </br>
At the start of the game, the person allocates their stats by dividing a ration of sixteen points amongst the four skills. Each skill has a maximum of six points and minimum of one.

During gameplay, the person can perform a skill check alongside an action involving the child. </br>
The skill the check is performed on must have a reasonable connection to the action the person is attempting. </br>
Skill checks consist of the person rolling a d6. If their score exceeds the person's stat for the skill being checked, the check fails. Otherwise it succeeds. </br>
On a successful check, the child must cooperate with the person's action. Otherwise, the child is unaffected and person suffers fatigue.

#### Fatigue
Unless otherwise specified, after a failed skill check the person must apply a one point debuff to the skill they attempted the check with. </br>
Fatigue debuffs stack to up to three times, after which the person can no longer make checks with the affected skill. </br>
All fatigue debuffs are reset upon the Encounter's conclusion.

### The Child

The child's objective is to pursue the following sub-objectives as much as they wish to, in order of increasing priority:
- Do things they find fun/interesting/engaging.
- Avoid things that make them uncomfortable.
- Maintain their own independance.
- Survive. </br>

The child has no stats; they don't need to pass checks to attempt an action. </br>



## Structure
The game takes place over a period of five weeks. Each week contains two Encounters; one Session and one Engagement. 

### Engagements
Informal events characterised by the presence of a setting or objective, decided upon by the person.
The engagements should constitute positive experiences for the child, contributing to their development and wellbeing.
The child may not agree with the person's definition of the above, or be interested in the event at all.

### Sessions
Formal meetings where the person assesses the child's condition and discusses challenges.
The person is expected to maintain a professional manner and make their role clear to the child: to aid this, failing a skill check in a Session does not cause fatigue.

### Win Conditions

The person wins if the child's wellbeing has improved over their five weeks with the person. </br>
The person also wins if they have the child sectioned, after having provided evidence that the child is a danger to themselves. </br>
The person loses if the child's wellbeing has worsened or remained the same. </br>

The child wins if what happens to them at the end of the game is what they wanted. Otherwise, they lose.</br>

## Notes
The child is less constrained by the rules than the person; the person's power constrains them instead. </br>
The rules are written as if only the person is meant to read them. </br>
The person's stats are always on average slightly inadequate for the needs of the child.
